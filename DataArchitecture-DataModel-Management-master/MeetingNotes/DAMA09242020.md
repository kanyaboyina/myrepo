## Meeting Notes


- Gaurav     presented Data Management Tools, Data Quality Process Flow, Data Quality     for Batch and Event based process, Data Quality for EDP2.0, Proposed Data     Quality process flow and Data profile metrices

- **Data     Quality Process Flow:**

- - Data profiling for MFS systems      are applied at source level and not at instream data.

  - Data profiling for TFS systems      are currently in progress

  - Explored the following options      in case of data inaccuracies:

  - - Stop the Data Profiling       process, if it is critical
    - Create a rule to fix the data       quality issues

  - Discussed on application of      Data Quality rules on the derived attributes once the data is ingested      into the integration layers

  - Currently Data Quality check      is applied on the data published to BI applications

- **Data     Quality for EDP 2.0:**

- - DMT team is looking for      Completeness and Accuracy of data at this point
  - Business Rules can be applied      at source level during Data Profiling 
  - Informatica Axon can be      leveraged for data validation rules based on Domain level

- **Proposed     Data Quality Process flow:**

- - Data issue would a SNOW ticket      to fix it
  - DMT team would prefer to clean      the data at the source level
  - CDW/DMT Factory will monitor      and fix the data issue and generate the metrices to data steward and it      is an iterative process until the data is clean.

- **Data     Stewardship:**

- - Stewardship council is going      to kick off from Oct 6th

**Take Away points:**

- Importance of Data Quality as a     tool
- Data Quality on data ingestion     and data discovery in the pipeline 



**UCM and UPM exception consideration:**

- Pratima     discussed on Fraud Management System (FMS) for TFS request to extract     Retail and Lease Customer Demographic data via UPM API
- Downstream     applications would need regression testing for UCM data consumption
- UPM     APIs will be available in mid of November
- Informatica     Axon can be leveraged for data lineage purpose
